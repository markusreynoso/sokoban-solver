# Sokoban Solver

This project was originally an output for my Introduction to Artificial Intelligence class which I enjoyed very much. Our main task was simply to write the algorithm that will solve at least several maps that were only available to us on the day of the presentation. We were given some Driver codes, sample maps, and basic GUI files to start us off. 

I was very proud of this project and I didn't want this to just collect dust in my files so I went ahead and revised most of the code and created a GUI for a map editor; the original starter codes read maps from text files.
